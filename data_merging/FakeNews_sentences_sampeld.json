disadvantaged relative to men\nit is true that at first glance men dominate every field from business to pok\u00e9mon go achievements  which can lead some to think that there is a conspiracy against women but the male superiority in many fields is exactly what allows society to prosper years after the humiliating debunking of the wage gap its time to address the real elephant in the room the fact that women dont pay taxes\na research report on the fiscal contribution of men and women across age groups was published by the victoria university of wellington  lets explore the key findings\n\nthis is the wellknown earnings gap incorrectly referred to as the wage gap womens preference for low paying jobs among others is a factor at play here another factor is the amount of women working part time the average week for women in this research was  hours and  for men the workforce participation rate did not differ between men and women in significant ways\n\nthis is the disposable income this is the income remaining after deduction of taxes and other mandatory charges available to be spent or saved as one wishes you can see that progressive taxes unfairly impact males  and reduces males disposable income near womens although the market income was almost double that of womens if it disproportionately affects men  you can be assured that no one will complain\n\nthose are the raw taxes paid by men and women the tax gap has oddly never been an gender issue until now\n\nwhen the tax money received by men and women is included in the equation you can see that for most of womens lives except between  to  they receive more tax money than they supply the state with men on the other hand give the state more tax money than they receive from  to  years\n\nthis is where it gets upsetting as you can see womens short period of positive fiscal impact doesnt come close to counterbalance an already massive overall negative impact the net fiscal incidence on men is approximately zero when accumulated over all ages as such society invests in young males and they subsequently pay back societys investment women bear massive costs to society while we were taught to see them as underprivileged\nby the end of her life the average woman will cost about  to the average taxpayer this means that an average man is extorted  in his lifetime that will be directly transferred to women if men could use that money to their will women would chase men as much as men chase women nowadays\nthere are a few confounds that need to be ruled out the authors mention specifically that health and education costs are almost equal for men and women also the workforce percentage doesnt exceed  difference between men and women women dont spend more for children either according to the report even if there were confounds that needed to be accounted for this is not something feminists have done for the cent wage gap they have compared raw percentages without accounting for any confounding factors\nalso these numbers do not include massive costs for the governmental budget for womens issues that is a massive burden for the state for instance my local government from a canadian province of  million people just announced a  plan to fight sexual violence against women  after two immigrants dingdongditched women in a student house \nadd to that millions invested in sexed programs in which a feminist teaches boys that porn movies tailored for them shouldnt be imitated and that instead that they should have their partners pleasure in mind while teaching the exact opposite to girls the government takes money from males to empower women into hating men and their contribution to society\nhttpstcornbrpfws qu\u00e9bec canada announces  million plan against sexual violence after two foreigners touched female students\n nicolas kilsdonk nkgervais october   \n\nthe data also doesnt include all the money directly and personally transferred from a man to a woman for instance while women make so little they still account for  of all consumer purchases  and you were wondering why marketers so desperately try to appeal to women in advertisements\na metaphor for male taxpayers and women this is a real danone ad watch it here or see my comment here \nthe only defense that feminists can use when confronted with these facts is that women invest so much time in children however feminists made it very clear in the past decades that a womans contribution to society shouldnt be based on her involvement with children moreover at birth rates of half the necessary  birthrate for population stability theyre also doing the children thing pretty badly\nthese findings raise a serious question would feminism survive a libertarian regime that doesnt involve male tax money after all it is not a coincidence that women consistently vote for a welfare state within  years of womens suffrage in the usa the government doubled their tax expenditure and revenue  womens voting patterns have made the government become the new providing husband but this time the providing husband doesnt get a woman or children in return remove taxes and no woman will ever claim to be a strong independent woman the state is cucking you a little like if prostitution was not only legal but free  most guys would probably be strong independent single males\npretty ironic that the institution that gives money to women for being pregnant prevents them from being paid less makes abortions affordable is entirely supported by men feminists are not seriously against living in a society entirely supported by men they are just against men having the autonomy over the wealth they create male wealth is a public good and female wealth is her body her choice\nits time we fight for
