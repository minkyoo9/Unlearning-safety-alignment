'Nice one, Harry!' said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper's gloves Harry had given him.", "\"I was very lucky to collect this,\" he said, as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. \"As you will understand when we have experienced it. Shall we?\"", "Now Harry came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago. \"I think he's left the school to do something with the Order,\" said Hermione in a low voice. \"I mean .", "it's not that easy, is it?\" said Ron. He paused.", ". . and so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he knew.", "\"Is Mr. Weasley still at work?\" Harry asked. \"Yes, he is.", ".

Can you keep a secret, Tom?", "\"Now you can give that graffitied copy back.\" \"Are you mad?\" said Harry.", "\"Well, yes, I'm sure,\" said Mrs. Weasley, \"but I thought perhaps - given how - how he -\"\n\"You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per'aps, you hoped?\" said Fleur, her nostrils flaring.", "Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles.

She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away. \"She'll ban you from the library if you're not careful.", "\"Harry Potter!\" said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time. \"Oh, hello,\" said Harry unenthusiastically.", ". . Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case .", "Nobody answered. Harry looked over Hermione's shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bill's pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment.", "The Ministry wasn't so keen to be pals last year.\" They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush.", "\"You did?\" said Harry, amused. \"Yeah .", "Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?\" \"Won't, won't, won\u2019t, won't \u2014\"\nHarry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius, was repugnant.", "I am yours to command.\" Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. \"And what will become of those whom you command?", "You know how these spells come and go. , . .\"", "'You are afraid to act until they join\nyou.'?

The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body.", "\"D'you reckon this is safe to open?\" he asked. \"Can't be anything dangerous, all our mail's still being searched at the Ministry,\" replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously.", "\"Ml this new security, an kids are still gettin' hurt. . .", "\"That's right,\" said Hermione. \"Personally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but \u2014\" \n\"Quite enough chat over here!\" said Professor Sprout briskly, bustling over and looking stern.", "Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas?\" \"Yes, I am,\" said Ginny. \"And last time I looked, he was definitely one boy, not five.", "Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. 'It's taking longer than I thought it would.' Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say.", "\"The wandmaker?\" said Ginny, looking startled. \"That's the one.", "Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy s hair, looking dumbfounded. \"Do you mean \u2014\u201c\nMalfoy shrugged. \"Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don't see it as that important these days.", "\u201cThat job's jinxed.

We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody.", "I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were.", ". Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around.", "\"To know what really happened at the Ministry.\" said Harry. \"Him and everyone else here,\" sniffed Hermione.", "\"Oh, I've just escaped \u2014 I mean, I've just left Cormac,\" she said. \"Under the mistletoe,\" she added in explanation, as Harry continued to look questioningly at her. \"Serves you right for coming with him,\" he told her severely.", "\"I had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous assignments,\" said Snape silkily. \"This can be easily arranged: I shall speak to the Dark Lord--\"\n\"I can speak to him myself if I want to!\" \"Of course you can,\" said Snape, sneering.", "I mean,\" he added defensively, spinning the bowler hat still faster, \"all the evidence pointed--we had more than fifty eyewitnesses--but anyway, as I say, he's dead. Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises.", "\"Who suspects me?\" said Malfoy angrily. \"For the last time, I didn't do it, okay?", "But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxr with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\"", "\"Loads of people go \nto Borgin and Burkes . . .", "All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harry's Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work. \"Thanks a lot, Hermione,\" said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o'clock. \"Listen, I\u2019ve got to hurry or I'll be late for Dumbledore.", "I am not proud of it, I was wrong, but there it is. ...

He hesitated a moment, then said, \"Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?\" \"I dunno,\" said Harry.", "'Prince, Hermione, Prince!' 'Right!' said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of Harry.", "\"We wanted to see you.\" \"We've missed you!\" said Hermione tremulously.", "\"Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,\" said McLaggen. \"We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour ?this was before he became Minister, obviously ?quot;\n\"Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?\" beamed Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed out.", "Harry frowned at her. \"Always jump to the worst conclusion, don't you?\" \"Was it?\"", "\"We all know you can't get enough of her.\" This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron's mother. Starting to feel that he was missing something, Harry said, \"Who are you ?", "\"I mean . . .", "Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and Hermione seemed cheery too, though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said, \"It's a nice day.\" Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside Harry's brain: \n  \nShe's Rons sister. But she's ditched Dean!", "\"Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\" -' \"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away. .", "Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the Evening Prophet.

Some of the elf-made wine will do.\"", "Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledores face. It was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water.

Still, it might be reusable.\" He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light, examining the thick liquid within.", "Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole.

His mustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain.", "\"Oho,\" said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see.
